1. Instead of using the readme.md file to keep track of what we are currently working on and what has been done, we use this file.
2. We can also use very few resources like using a miniscule network and playing only a few games per iteration, this will enable us to run and test our code on our machines.
3. Also look we should follow the Julia [style guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/) to name varibales and modules etc.
