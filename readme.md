# MuZero.jl

Here we are implementing the MuZero algorithm in Julia. The code is being written keeping general usage and compatibility in mind. Working parts mostly structured as per the pseudocode are written in simple yet explained short modules.

After cloning, 'cd MuZero.jl' and then in REPL ']instantiate .' to install dependencies and work in the MuZero.jl environment.
